          <h2>Hick's Law</h2>
          <h3> Amazon -  <a href="https://www.amazon.com/">  Website </a>   </h3>

         Hick's Law states the time required to make a decision increases as more options are provided. 
         In Web Design it is important to keep this in mind. As we are trying to present efficient pages
         to our users, it is important to remember to not overwhelm them with options. The Amazon website 
         does a wonderful job exemplifying this principle. Amazon has millions of items available and hundreds
         of options and tools to access, yet with all that in mind, they were very intentional about what options
         they present.

          <h2>White Space & Clean Design</h2>
          <h3> Crate & Barrel -  <a href="https://www.crateandbarrel.com"> Website </a>   </h3>
          <img class= "colimage" src="images/CrateBarrel.jpg" alt="Amazon.com Home Page - Mobile">
        Crate and Barrel as a company have a fantastic graphic design team. Their packaging and branding
        are a perfect example of white space and clean design. In this case, their website has very minimal
        text and allows for the images and "airy" feel to dominate the page. Their brand is simple and 
        luxurious and their website helps to emulate that. It is important to keep the aesthtic of a business
        in mind when designing content.

          <h2>Rule of Thirds</h2>
          <h3> Target -  <a href="https://www.target.com/">  Website </a>   </h3>
          <img class= "colimage" src="images/Target.jpg" alt="Amazon.com Home Page - Mobile">
          The Rule of Thirds states that the most pleasing area for focal points is within the
          intersction of the above grid. Also, content is often designed that the sections are broken 
          up roughly into thirds. Here the upper right intersection directs you to the woman's face, her 
          gaze directs you to the next intersection to the left featurnig the page headline, whichleads 
          you to the sub headline and so on. Designing with the rule of thirds in mind will lead to the most
          visually appealing designs to observe.
