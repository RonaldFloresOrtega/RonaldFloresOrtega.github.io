	  <p>Situated in eastern Lima in the upscale district of La Molina, the Lima Peru Temple, accentuated by six statuesque spires, rises resolutely above heavily traveled Avenida Javier Prado. The spacious grounds of the temple are thoughtfully landscaped to create a peaceful haven for waiting patrons or anyone seeking refuge from the worries of the world. An accommodation center shares the grounds, offering living quarters, a cafeteria, and a family history center. The Peru Missionary Training Center is also located in La Molina, just a short drive from the temple.</p>

    <h2>Blessings of the Temple</h2>

    <div class="news">
    <p>My beloved brothers and sisters, how grateful I am to be with you this beautiful Easter morning when our thoughts turn to the Savior of the world. I extend my love and greetings to each of you and pray that our Heavenly Father will inspire my words.</p>

    <p>This conference marks seven years since I was sustained as President of the Church. They have been busy years, filled not only with a few challenges but also with countless blessings. Among the most enjoyable and sacred of these blessings has been my opportunity to dedicate and rededicate temples.</p>

    <p>Most recently, this past November it was my privilege to dedicate the beautiful new Phoenix Arizona Temple. I was joined by President Dieter F. Uchtdorf, Elder Dallin H. Oaks, Elder Richard J. Maynes, Elder Lynn G. Robbins, and Elder Kent F. Richards. On the evening prior to the dedication, a marvelous cultural celebration was held where over 4,000 of our youth from the temple district performed beautifully. The following day the temple was dedicated in three sacred and inspiring sessions.</p>

    <p>The building of temples is a very clear indication of the growth of the Church. We currently have 144 temples in operation worldwide, with 5 being renovated and 13 more under construction. In addition, 13 temples which were previously announced are in various stages of preparation before construction begins. This year we anticipate rededicating 2 temples and dedicating 5 new temples which are scheduled for completion.</p>
