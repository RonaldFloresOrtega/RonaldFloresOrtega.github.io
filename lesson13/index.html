          The Columbia River Washington Temple is the 107th operating temple of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS Church).
          <br><br>
          The Columbia River Washington Temple, located in Richland near Badger Mountain, is the third temple in the state of Washington, following the Seattle Washington and Spokane Washington temples. Church membership in Washington has grown from 67,000 members in 1970 to nearly 230,000 in 2001. Because of the tremendous growth church leaders felt another temple should be built within the state. The Columbia River Temple serves 32,000 members in eastern Washington and northern Oregon.
          <br><br>
          Some parts of the temple foundation includes 2-inch river rock used as fill in concrete forms. During construction of the temple, people were allowed access to open bins of this river rock at the edge of the construction site. Many people wrote names of children, loved ones, etc. on the rocks that were later incorporated into the building itself.
